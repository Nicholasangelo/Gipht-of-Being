The Human Experience is an observatory, starry with existential peaks and valleys, which flourish and burst in pitch and tempi.  We suffer times of great wealth and of great sorrow and must cherish each, equally, to fully experience life. Choose a State of Being, and recreate it. Change your state. Experience change to accept the gift of being.
